Advanced Turbine Troubleshooting and Diagnostics

Introduction:
This document provides comprehensive guidance on advanced troubleshooting and diagnostic techniques for both wind and gas turbines. It covers systematic approaches to complex problems, root cause analysis methodologies, and specialized diagnostic tools.

Systematic Troubleshooting Approach:

1. Data Collection and Analysis:
   - Establish baseline performance parameters
   - Collect operational data preceding the issue
   - Identify deviation patterns from normal operation
   - Analyze transient behavior during fault occurrence
   - Review historical patterns of similar issues

2. Symptom Categorization:
   - Mechanical symptoms: Vibration, noise, physical damage
   - Thermal symptoms: Temperature deviations, hotspots
   - Performance symptoms: Power reduction, efficiency loss
   - Control symptoms: Instability, hunting, oscillations
   - Electrical symptoms: Voltage/current irregularities, trip events

3. Diagnostic Decision Trees:
   - Symptom-based branching logic
   - Elimination of impossible causes
   - Probability-weighted investigation paths
   - Verification testing at each decision point
   - Documentation of reasoning process

4. Root Cause Analysis Methods:
   - 5-Why technique
   - Fishbone (Ishikawa) diagram
   - Fault tree analysis
   - Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA)
   - Pareto analysis for recurring issues
